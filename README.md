### Image Classification using Machine Learning 

Building a classifier that leverages keras, pre-trained [imagenet](*) model and cosine similarity to classify and group similar kind of image in folder to the given sample image.

**Datasets**

1. *[Dataset used](./Data/Dataset)* - Here you can find data sample used for testing this classifier. It contains multiple sample images of dogs of different breeds (German shepherd,Golden Retriever,pug)

2. *[Sample](./Data/Sample)* - Here we have a image of germen shepherd as sample in sample folder.

**Conclusion**

*[ClassifiedImages](./Data/ClassifiedImages)* -  Contains all the grouped images after classification.
