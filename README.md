### **Image Classification Using Machine Learing Model**
In this project, We are creating a machine learning classifier to classify and group similar kind of image to the sample images from the given dataset. The model leverages [Keras-API](https://keras.io/) to process the images and [imagenet model](https://www.image-net.org/) to extract features of the images. So It can be classified based on the [cosine similarity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cosine-similarity#:~:text=Cosine%20similarity%20measures%20the%20similarity,document%20similarity%20in%20text%20analysis) of sample image and rest of image in dataset.


-  **[Dataset Used](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-1z61aeaxTmLo4hj8RL491yS36UVES2_?usp=drive_link)** - Contains all the dataset including `TrainData/` (contains all the images of dogs) and `sampleImg/` (contains a single img of the germen sheperd)
- **[Training Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JIEuyIQm7M45sz9ZnunbeFo8qoPJUyB5?usp=drive_link)** - Contains image of dogs of all breed (germen shepred,pug and golden retriver)
- **[SampleImg](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16iVIgZIUNJL9w1J-VFtTiuibmee5OeeN?usp=drive_link)** - Contains a single image of the handsome guy we used as a sample
